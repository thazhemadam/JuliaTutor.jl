#This file contains an Example Lesson plan for Julia tutor.

prompt_1 = ""*
"Welcome to your first day of class. Today we'll be doing a classic exercise.\n"*
"We will be learning how to print text to our console. Along the way we'll cover some ways to handle strings in Julia."*
"\n"*
"Strings are defined by double quotes \" \" in julia.\n\n"*
"For example, we could define a variable called console_output to contain the text \"hello world\" like the following - \n"*
"\tconsole_output = \"hello world\"\n"*
"\n"*
"Okay, now it's your turn!\n"
request_1 = "Define a string titled \'console_output\' to contain the text \"hello world\""
evaluator_1 = ExpressionEvaluator(:console_output, "hello world")
hint_1 = """Please ensure your solution is cases sensitive.
IE: "HeLlO WoRlD" is not the same as "hello world". """

#These four items compose a single lesson instance.
lesson_1 = Lesson( prompt_1, request_1, evaluator_1, hint_1 )

prompt_2 = ""*
"Congratulations you have instantiated your first variable in Julia!\nHow might we display this "*
"text to console?\nThere are two functions that let you do this:\n\t print() and println().\nPrint " *
"will display the String or variable as it is, but println will add a new line/carriage return"
" to the end of it.\n"*
"\n"*
"Now that our console_output variable is stored in memory, we can print it as follows:\n"*
"print(console_output)\n"
request_2 = "Print your \'console_output\' variable to the console using the `print()` function"
evaluator_2 = CommandEvaluator("hello world")
#Notice: we did not provide any hints for this excercise. Not nice, but either they get it,
#or they don't. 
lesson_2 = Lesson( prompt_2, request_2, evaluator_2 )

#To create the lesson_plan (which is REQUIRED) we make an array of Lesson's.
